# IP-Project

Just started overwatch? A long time player? This is the site that you need! Introducing OverBrowse, a simplified website/application for all your overwatch needs. From Hero Wikipedias to In-depth tutorials, we cover a wide range of knowledge more than you'll ever need.

Design Process--------------------------------
I made this website with the intention to help players that are just starting out overwatch. This website serves as a place that players can learn from and if they are interested also learn about the lore behind each of the characters.

As a player, I would like to become better at the game I am playing. This website helps by providing useful information that will be needed for the user to improve such as useful tips and tricks as well as character skillsets

There are three wireframes. Two for mobile and one for Desktop view(Only low poly). Those were submitted under AD.

Features/Existing Features--------------------------------
Navigation Bar
Links to index.html, comics.html, novels.html, aboutus.html.
The navbar changes to window styled when there is no space to contain the entire navigation bar(can be toggle)
Search Icon that when clicked expands into a search bar

Swiper
Displays 4 character skins. Rotates to a different skin every now and then or can be changed by clicking on the image and dragging it to swipe to the next image

Features Left to Implement ------------------------------
Unfortunately these are features that I am currently not able to do. But with time I should be able to do
Implement a working database for contact.html
Implement Disqus to comments in zenyetta.html
Fix weird fonts that look bland
Implement a working Login (Account creation + Database to store it)
Tidy up bland parts (Leaderboards looks quite boring)
Make the comment section actually look good

##### Documentation ------------------------------------------------------

##### Thinking points

# ● Is the web site sound and fits the audience intent?

Just started overwatch? A long time player? This is the site that you need! Introducing OverBrowse, a simplified website/application for all your overwatch needs. From Hero Wikipedias to In-depth tutorials, we cover a wide range of knowledge more than you'll ever need.

OverBrowse is a website similar to wikepedias but for Overwatch. Containing useful information on characters such as their skills and also providing resources such as tutorials for users to see.

# ● Have you tested across browsers?

The website has so far been tested in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge

# ● Is the website developed as close to what was proposed in the wireframe and documentation?

Not to the tee, but there are some very minor changes made compared to the wireframe

# ● Is the navigation structure sound?

Although unfinished. There is a perfect walkthrough of what the navigation should be like due to the sheer amount of work needed if the navigation must be
thoroughly completed

##### Real world application

# ● Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text

✓

# ● All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked

✓

# ● The final application is aligned to the user stories presented at the start of the project

✓

# ● Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have clearly been followed. All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented.

✓

##### Version control systems are used effectively:

# ● all code is managed in git with well-described commit messages

All commits done :D (Although there may be lengthy instances like a few hours between them)

# ● there is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fit

Not well defined

# ● there are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the development process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism##

There are very large commits (Finishing like 10-20% of a html at once). (Not sure if that is large). But details and references are clearly stated.

##### The full application development process is documented:

✓

# ● the purpose of the application is clearly described in the README

✓

# ● the project's documentation describes the design work undertaken for this project and the reasoning behind it

✓

# ● wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of the design process are

✓ (Submitted to AD)

# ● Huge Problem I faced

There was about 20 or so hours trying to find an api to use. Was thinking of disqus at first but it was too hard to implement. Then moved towards Wordpress, which I installed XAMPP for an also followed multiple instances of procedures but all of them still happened to fail (basically 15 or so hrs). So I decided to opt for restdb to store 'Contact Us' information from contact.html. But then, i realised that this whole time three.js was already an API :D.
