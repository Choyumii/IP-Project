            <h1>Lore</h1>
          </a>
          Zenyatta is an omnic monk who wanders the world in search of spiritual
          enlightenment, helping those he meets to overcome their personal
          struggles and find inner peace. It is said that those who cross his
          path are never the same again. He believes that by forming people into
          relationships, the world can be healed, and a better society created.
          But, when necessary, he will fight to protect the innocent, be they
          omnic or human.
          <br ><br >
          The orbs Zenyatta uses were hand-carved at the Shambali monastary and
          serve as a means to channel omnic energy. Zenyatta does not know who,
          exactly, created them, and their function is a mystery; while
          seemingly magical, in Zenyatta's words, "what seems like magic is
          sometimes science we don't yet understand." Similarly, Zenyatta is
          able to levitate without repulsors, an ability he has attributed to
          the Iris.
          <br ><br >
          Zenyatta believes that as long as free will exists, there will always
          be evil in the world, yet to deny free will would also be evil. He has
          the ability to dream.<br >
          <br >
          Zenyatta found humans' manner of speech perplexing at first, having
          little grasp of metaphors. He still occasionally struggles with their
          figures of speech.
          <br ><br >
          Like all Shambali, despite being unable to eat, Zenyatta knows how to
          prepare food.
          <br ><br >

          <h1>Background</h1>
          <b>Pre-Crisis</b>

          <br ><br >
          “ What did you do? You know, before the Crisis?
          <br >
          I served coffee. I collected payments at a laser tag arena. I was a
          lifeguard at a water park. I drove a tractor.<br >
          Is that true?<br >
          He won't tell me either. „<br >
          ~ Reinhardt, Zenyatta, and Genji discuss the omnic's early life
          Zenyatta was constructed before the Omnic Crisis. When asked what he
          did before the war, Zenyatta claimed to have served coffee, collect
          payments at a laser tag arena, act as a water park lifeguard, and be a
          tractor driver. Whether this is true or not is something Zenyatta has
          always refused to divulge. He has stated that his memories before the
          Awakening are blurry.<br ><br >
          <b>The Shambali</b>

          <br >
          <b> Ramattra and Zenyatta meet</b>

          <br ><br >
          After the Crisis, Zenyatta was recruited into the Shambali by
          Ramattra, who hoped that Zenyatta could find purpose with the Shambali
          as he had. The two became "as close as brothers," and spent years
          discussing the problems facing omnics, including the injustices being
          committed by humans. At some point, however, Ramattra committed an
          action that nearly resulted in Zenyatta's death. After Ramattra
          founded Null Sector, he and Zenyatta ceased all contact.
          <br ><br >
          After the fall of Overwatch, while still with the Shambali, Zenyatta
          encountered Genji, who had left Overwatch and was conflicted with his
          nature as a cyborg. Though Genji initially rejected Zenyatta's wisdom,
          the benevolent omnic would not be deterred. In time, Zenyatta became
          his mentor, and under the monk's tutelage, Genji reconciled his dual
          existence as both man and machine,[14] as Zenyatta helped his student
          see both his trials and his cybernetic form as a unique strength.
          <br ><br >
          Zenyatta would later consider Genji to be one of his brightest pupils.
          After Genji left his tutelage, Zenyatta began to see the limits of the
          Shambali path. He believed that the way to repair the problems between
          humans and omnics was not through dogmatic teaching but through
          interpersonal connection and engagement.
          <br ><br >
          Ultimately, Zenyatta followed his own path. He chose to leave the
          monastery and wander the world, helping those he meets to overcome
          their personal struggles and find inner peace.
